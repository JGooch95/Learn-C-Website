			<h2>The basic programming constructs</h2>
			
			<!-- Page description -->
			<p>
				When writing code for a program you will be using 3 constructs which will be used together to make solutions to the problems at hand these constructs are 
				sequence, selection and iteration.
			</p>
			
			<!-- Sequence heading and description -->
			<section class="step">
				<p>Sequence</p>
			</section>
			<p>
				The sequence structure is when instructions are performed one by one in the order that they're written, This is the general way that code works so this
				structure is being used at all times within code in software.
			</p>
			
			<!-- Selection heading and description -->
			<section class="step">
				<p>Selection</p>
			</section>
			<p>
				The selection structure is when there is a choice in the instruction path which leads to one set of code being run or an alternative piece of code being run 
				dependant on a condition.
			</p>
			
			<!-- Iteration heading and description -->
			<section class="step">
				<p>Iteration</p>
			</section>
			<p>
				The iteration structure is when the instructions are looped until a condition is met or while a condition is present.
