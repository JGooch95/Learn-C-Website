			<h2>Programming Standards</h2>
			
			<!-- Page description -->
			<p>
				When programming the code starts to build up and eventually reading the code within a program may become difficult to understand and maintain
				 so to ensure the code is kept in a maintainable standard programmers tend to adhere to a set of programming standards / rules.
			</p>
			
			<!-- Indentation heading and description" -->
			<section class="step">
				<p>Indentation</p>
			</section>
			<p>
				Indentation is where anything which is within a construct gets indented, this is done by pressing the tab key. This means that if the programmer wants to 
				know what is within a construct they just have to look at how far out the text is. e.g.<br>
			</p>
			
			<!-- Indentation Example -->
			<pre><code>
if (x == 1)
{
	x += 1;
}
			</code></pre>
				
			<p>
				The space before the x += 1 is an indent showing that within the if (x==1) there is a x+=1.
				So the line reads if x is equal to one add one to x.
			</p>
			
			<!-- Naming conventions heading and description" -->
			<section class="step">
				<p>Naming Conventions</p>
			</section>
			<p>
				With naming conventions the programmers use a certain way of naming their variables to stay consistent.
				This may be by using uppercase notation which means making the start of every new word in the variable name uppercase.<br>
				e.g.<br> 
				<br>
				<span><code>Name</code></span><br>
				<br>
				A common notation used is to use the upper-case notation with the data type notated at the front of the
				name.<br>
				e.g.<br>
				<br>
				
				<span><code>strName </code></span>(str = string).
			</p>
			
			<!-- Segmentation heading and description" -->
			<section class="step">
				<p>Segmentation</p>
			</section>
			<p>
				Segmentation is when you break down code into logical chunks. This is done by breaking the code up into sets of instructions which
				perform a single task.<br>
				e.g.
			</p>
			
			<!-- Segmentation Example -->
			<pre><code>
cout &lt;&lt; "What is your name?";
cin &gt;&gt; strName;

cout &lt;&lt; "Your name is " &lt;&lt; strName;
			</code></pre>
			
			<p>
				This code is broken into 2 parts, The user entry and the output as they are 2 logical blocks of code.
				The code above outputs text to the sceen asking the users name, then it waits for the user to enter something,
				What they enter is stored as strName and then their name is output to the screen with a message.
			</p>
			
			<!-- Commenting heading and description" -->
			<section class="step">
				<p>Commenting</p>
			</section>
			<p>
				To ensure whoever reads the code understands what is going on; the code should be commented. These will be lines of text which are within
				the code which won't be read by the computer when running the software. These comments put into the code should be as short and precise as
				possible to be the most efficient.<br>
				e.g.
			</p>
			
			<!-- Commenting Example 1 -->
			<pre><code>
<span class="comment">//User input</span>
cout &lt;&lt; "What is your name?";
cin &gt;&gt; strName;

<span class="comment">//Output</span>
cout &lt;&lt; "Your name is " &lt;&lt; strName;
			</code></pre>
				
			<p>
				The text with 2 slashes next to them are the comments. To signify a comment you have to put 2 slashes (//comment) if it pans over a single line and
				a / and an asterisk (/*comment*/) if it goes over multiple lines.<br>
				e.g.
			</p>
				
			<!-- Commenting Example 2 -->
			<pre><code>
<span class="comment">/* User input:</span>
<span class="comment">Prompts the user and retrieves the data. */</span>
cout &lt;&lt; "What is your name?";
cin &gt;&gt; strName;
					
<span class="comment">//Output</span>
cout &lt;&lt; "Your name is " &lt;&lt; strName;
			</code></pre>
